## Ressources
The data was mined from four German online dictionaries.
Each dictionary got a reliability score.
The dictionaries were:
- (dwds)[https://www.dwds.de/] (0.5)
- (duden)[https://www.duden.de/] (1.0)
- (synonyme_de)[https://www.synonyme.de/] (1.0)
- (wordassosiactions)[https://wordassociations.net/de/] (0.8)

The sites mined for words assosiacted with this feeling. The reliability scores of each ressource, where a word was found were added up.

This step was repeated for the most important assosiactions.

For every emotion (but love and conrempt) feelings from (Roman Klinger and Surayya Samat Suliya)[https://bitbucket.org/rklinger/german-emotion-dictionary/src/master/] were added with a score of 1.0.
